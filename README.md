Zeitgeist provides some lightweight and swifty classes around `Date`. Somewhat inspired by Ruby on Rails 🤷‍♂️.

## Contributions and support

This project does not come with GitHub Issues-based support, and users are instead encouraged to become active participants in its continued development — by fixing any bugs that they encounter, or by improving the documentation wherever it’s found to be lacking.

If you wish to make a change, [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/FlorianMielke/Zeitgeit/pull/new) — even if it just contains a draft of the changes you’re planning, or a test that reproduces an issue — and we can discuss it further from there.

—Florian
